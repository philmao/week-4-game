# Crystal Collector (Week 4 Game)

## Overview
The app generates a random number at the start of the game and different values for each of the four crystal buttons. When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game. The player loses if their score goes above the random number.  The app shows the number of games the player wins and loses.
